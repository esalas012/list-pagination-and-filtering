# List-Pagination-Filtering

In this project I used a technique known as pagination to enhance the 
user experience. These improvements follow a progressive enhancement strategy.
This means that these improvements do not affect the core HTML and CSS, 
and will work with a list of any number of students.

I added extra credit features to my project to earn an "Exceeds Expectations" grade.
These new features are:	
 1. Dynamically create and append a search bar
 2. When the "Search" button is clicked, the list is filtered by student name for 
    those that include the search value
 3. Added a keyup event  listener to the search input so that the list filters in 
    real time as the user types. 
 4. Display pagination links based on how many search results are returned. 
 5. A message is displayed when no results are found.
